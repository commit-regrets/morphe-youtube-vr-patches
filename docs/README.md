# Development notes

Working notes behind the patches in this repository. They are written for whoever has to
re-derive the patches against a future app version — they are not user documentation.

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| [FINGERPRINTS.md](FINGERPRINTS.md) | Which matchers anchor on facts R8 cannot rename and which are bound to the current obfuscation map, with the re-anchoring strategy per fingerprint — read this first when a new app version lands. |
| [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md) | What the version list means, why an unlisted version is *skipped* rather than failed, how to try one anyway, what to report, and the maintainer checklist for adding support for a new version. |
| [INTERNALS.md](INTERNALS.md) | The verified hook map for the supported version (class/member → anchor → which patch uses it), the patch cookbook (where the next patches would go), the verification recipe and the traps that cost real time. Start here to author a new patch. |
| [GETTING-THE-APK.md](GETTING-THE-APK.md) | Where the Quest APK actually comes from (it is not on the mirror sites — those carry the Daydream build), the version rule, and why this repository never ships the APK. |
| [APP-NAME-CARD.md](APP-NAME-CARD.md) | Why a cloned build shows `App name unavailable` in the dock, with the decompiled data path and the guard on every API that could name it — **settled: no in-APK fix exists**, and the `com.oculus.app_id` variant was implemented and measured. Read this before trying anything about the app's name or the store's "restore" prompt. |
| [SPONSORBLOCK-PLAN.md](SPONSORBLOCK-PLAN.md) | Research and implementation plan for SponsorBlock in the VR app (auto-skip only): the phone patch's design as the reference, the seven player hooks this app gives us **with measured uniqueness counts**, and the one blocking unknown — the playback-position accessor — with the candidate routes and fallbacks. Read this before starting the feature. |
